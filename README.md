# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## My Task

This week's Challenge requires me to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. 


## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

```

## Acheivements

```
Added javascript to prompt my own custom prompt instead of default browser prompt to make it look fancier; 
this prompt first asks for password length between 8 to 128 (only numbers allowed !).

Added javascript to confirm my own custon confirm box instaed of default browser confirm box to make it look fancier;
this confirm box confirms criterias whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.

Added code to generate random password according to criteria selected using length user specified.

Finally added code to display generated random secure password.
